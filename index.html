	<h1>Man Up for Gman: A Bachelor Party October Bash Man Night Event</h1>
	<h2 class="dates">WHEN: <span>Saturday, October 7th <bold>@ 5:00PM</bold></span></h2>
	<h2 class="dates">WHERE: <span>(Tuffy's bachelor pad) - 11809 Garden Grove Way, Louisville, KY 40299</span></h2>
	<p>
		It seems like only a month ago that Michael Martin Gonterman announced his engagment (mainly because it was only a month ago) and in an effort to truly make 2017 the year of Gman he'll be tying the knot in November.
	</p>

	<p>
		In honor of G's engagement we need to see Unwed Gman off in style and to do that we need your help to set a Guinness World Record for the largest, most epic Old School Man Night ever! We will be combining traditions from Man Nights and the yearly June Birthday Bash to create an event that is as unique as the man of the hour himself!
	</p>
	<p>
		We realize that this is very short notice and understand if it is difficult for you to attend... but Gman won't understand so Man Up for Gman!
	</p>
	<p>
		We have reserved G for Saturday & Sunday so this pretty much ends when Tuffy kicks us out ;). Everybody should feel free to crash at the venue as we will be having an excellent time and want everybody to stay safe by keeping the party going and the car keys in their pockets.
	</p>
